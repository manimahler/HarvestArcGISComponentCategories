HarvestArcGISComponentCategories for ArcGIS 10.x
------------------------------------------------

Commandline utility to use the component category information from an assembly 
and build an *.ecfg file for it without requiring administrative privileges.
The same could be done using ESRIRegasm.exe which, however, additionally 
registers the assembly on the current machine.

This tool is useful on build servers or when automatically creating an msi 
where it is not desireable write to the registry. For example, using WIX, the 
COM registration information would be typically harvested by Heat.exe while 
this tool creates the necessary .ecfg files to be placed in 
<ProgramFiles>\Common Files\ArcGIS\<Product>\Configuration\CATID\, for example 
C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\ArcGIS\Desktop10.0\Configuration\CATID or 
C:\Program Files\Common Files\ArcGIS\Server10.0\Configuration\CATID

Binaries are located in the bin directory.
